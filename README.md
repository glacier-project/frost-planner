# ðŸ§Š IceSheet
A Python library for solving Flexible Job-Shop scheduling problems.

IceSheet is a powerful and intuitive Python framework for modeling and solving scheduling instances, from classic Job-Shop and Flow-Shop problems to custom, real-world resource allocation tasks.

## Core Concepts
- Vast & Scalable: Designed to handle the immense, complex landscapes of modern scheduling problems.

- Structured & Precise: Transforms inputs into a crystalline, highly-ordered plan, much like snow compacting into glacial ice.

- Optimized Flow: Implements powerful algorithms to find the most efficient "flow" for your tasks, carving out the optimal path to completion.

## âœ¨ Features
- Multi-Algorithm Support: A suite of built-in schedulers ready to be deployed:

- Heuristics & Metaheuristics: Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search.

- Constraint Solvers: Wrappers for powerful solvers like Google OR-Tools.

- Dispatching Rules: Common rules like First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and Shortest Processing Time (SPT).

- Problem Modeling: An expressive API to define jobs, tasks, machines, and complex constraints.

- Extensible by Design: Easily add your own custom scheduling algorithms or problem types.

- Visualization Tools: Generate Gantt charts directly from a solved schedule to easily visualize the results.

- Pure Python: A clean, modern, and well-documented codebase.
